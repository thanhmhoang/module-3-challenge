# Module-3-Challenge

## Description

For this Module 3 Challenge, the challege was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria(s) that they've selected. This application will run in the browser and will contain HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. Through doing this challenge, I was able to have a better understanding of how to use JavaScript and how to create functions, set variables, and use for loops.

## Usage

To use this password generator, please click on this link, https://thanhmhoang.github.io/module-3-challenge/. When users reach the webpage, they can click the button to generate a password, then are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. Users must select a password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. They will also have to choose if they would like their password to contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. Users must choose at least one character type in order for their password to generate. Once the necessary criterias are met, a password that matches the selected criterias will be generated for the user.
